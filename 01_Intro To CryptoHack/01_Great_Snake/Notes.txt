import sys is used to import system information and modules
the element used here is called sys.version_info.major for the version of python

print("".join(chr(o ^ 0x32) for o in ords))

Here ^ in o^0x32 is called bitwise OR operation in python. 
You can simply do mathematical operation in different base numbers
example01.py is the example. 

Then comes the bitwise XOR with ^ sign, from 0x32 we get 50 and 
the binary of 50 in 8 bits is 00110010
if another value is 81 and binary in 8 bits is 01010001
Bitwise OR operation:
81 : 01010001
50 : 00110010
--------------------
XOR: 01100011 used the sign as ^
OR : 01110011 used the sign as |
AND: 00010000 used the sign as &

As example we have example02.py for demonstration.
